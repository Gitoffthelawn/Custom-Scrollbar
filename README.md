# Custom Scrollbars
Give your browser a personalized touch with custom scrollbar colors! You can select from any range of colors and toggle between the default width and thin scrollbar... or hide it altogether if that's what floats your boat.

### Localization
The Custom Scrollbars add-on is used by people around the world. I'd like to provide users with the best experience. As such, I'd love to make the add-on available in languages other than English. But for that, I need some help.

Seeing as I only know English, I need the people who use and love this add-on to help me translate it into other languages.

Thanks to the great folks at Crowdin, I have posted all of the English text that's used in the add-on to the Crowdin platform. If you'd like to help provide translations for the add-on, you can go to [the Custom Scrollbars page on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/custom-scrollbars) and start translating the add-on into other languages.

Don't see your language listed on Crowdin? I've included the languages that are most common (according to my add-on statistics), but I'd be happy to add other languages to the list. [Create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/WesleyBranton/Custom-Scrollbar/issues) and I'll add the language to the Crowdin page.

### Creating an issue
Issues are the ticketing system used on GitHub. It's used to track bugs and enhancements that developers can work on. Here are the 3 main types of issues and what to keep in mind when creating a new issue.

#### Bug
A bug is something that is not working properly in the add-on. Finding and fixing bugs is a very important part of maintaining this add-on.

When create a new issue for a bug, please make sure to include as much information as possible. This should include detailed steps on how to reproduce the problem and links to relevant website(s) (if applicable). Screenshots are also helpful, if an issue is visible.

Additional information about your computer operating system and the internet browser(s) that the issue occurs on is very helpful when trying to diagnose and fix problems.

#### Enhancement / Feature Request
We are always looking for ways to improve the Custom Scrollbars add-on. We welcome feedback and suggestions on how we can improve the add-on and new features that could be introduced.

When creating an issue for an enhancement or feature request, it can often be helpful to provide some background about why you think a change is needed and how it would be helpful to other users. Please make sure to search through the other issues on this GitHub repository to make sure that the feature you are looking for hasn't already been filed by someone else.

Sometimes new features may take a long time to be added to the add-on. Sometimes they may not be added at all. Please don't take it personally if your feature request is rejected or given a low priority.

#### Documentation Change
Sometimes features of the add-on or browsers can change and the documentation on the add-on's wiki page may no longer be accurate. Sometimes the documentation may be written in a way that is confusing or incomplete.

If you notice a problem with the documentation available for this add-on, feel free to make the change. However, if you don't have the required access to make a change, you can create an issue.

When creating an issue about a change to the documentation, please make sure to provide a link to the document in question and include what any changes in the issue description.

### Spread The Word
If you are enjoying the add-on, consider sharing it with your friends. New users are found almost entirely through word of mouth, so every little big of promotion helps.

Also, consider leaving a review on the add-on store page. These reviews help others find the add-on in the store search page.
